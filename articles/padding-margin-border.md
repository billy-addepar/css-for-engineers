# Paddings, Margins, and Borders, Oh My!

Welcome to the first of (hopefully many) Maddie's guides to CSS! This is aimed at engineers who don't already know CSS but are forced to work with it on occasion, and want to make sure they don't mess things up too badly. Don't worry - you'll do just fine. When in doubt, refer to these writeups, or feel free to ask me for help.

### Margins
Margins are the free space around an element that exist just outside the element's boundaries.

You can specify a margin for each side of an element
```
.element {
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-right: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  margin-left: 25px;
}
```
