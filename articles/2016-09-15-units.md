# :eyes: Units

<!-- intro -->

## Pixels

A pixel is considered the smallest base unit, representing a single dot in an image. Every digital image is made up of a grid of pixels.

Here is an example:

Generally when you're declaring the length of something in CSS, it will be using pixels (or `px`).

## Percentage

Percentages are *technically* not a unit of measurement, but they are the second most commonly used method to declare the length (or width, or margin, or anything) so it should still be discussed.

When an element has `width: 50%;`, its width will be 50% of its direct parent's. If its a top-level element (meaning it has no container other than `<body>`), its width will be 50% of the window.

## Physical Measurements

You can measure something in CSS using `in`, `cm`, and `mm`. The conversion is

```
1in == 96px, 1cm == 100mm == 37.8px
```

There is technically nothing wrong with using these units of measurement as they just convert directly into pixels and can be used the same way. However, it is really uncommon and the conversions are somewhat hard to remember. It also doesn't make logical sense to use physical measurements for something on the web, with the exception of `print`-specific styling.

## Conclusion

Use the unit of measurement that makes the most sense for what you're trying to do. When in doubt, use pixels.
